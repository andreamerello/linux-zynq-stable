OpenCores VGA/LCD controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "opencores,ocfb"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for the pixelclock generator.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.

Required sub-nodes:
- port: the connection to a bridge chip.  The connection is modelled
  using the OF graph bindings specified in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

Example:

ocdrm@43c10000 {
	compatible = "opencores,ocfb";
	reg = <0x43c10000 0x10000>;
	clocks = <&pix_clock>;
	port {
		rgb_out: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&bridge_in>;
		};
	};

};
